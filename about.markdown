Developer Advocate, enthusiast attracted by Clean Code concepts and maintainability principles (yeah for real... I really like to cleanup code).

##### Languages
I consider myself as language agnostic beside the fact that I mostly use to program in JAVA. It's just a syntax after all.
The most important concepts are valid for all languages, what is required is the "Programmer spirit".

##### OSS supporter
As most of developers, I used to consume open source software (in professional life but also for private side projects).
No doubt about the amazing job that these people do (biggup to them btw).

Since a few years now, I also try to contribute to this amazing world of OSS. 
I am surely not maintainer of huge projects such as Linux Kernel but still I try to share what I can with others at my humble level :)

If you are interested to my open sources contributions you can have a look at my [open source projects](./../oss/) or my contributions on [github](https://github.com/sebastienvermeille).
