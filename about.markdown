Developer Advocate, enthusiast attracted by Clean Code concepts and keeping code enjoyable to work with (aka maintainable).

##### Languages

I consider myself as a language agnostic programmer beside the fact that I mostly use to program in JAVA. It's just a syntax after all.
The most important concepts are valid for all languages, what is required is the "Programmer spirit".

Here is a subset of languages I've ever used:

* PHP (The first programming language I learned! if we exclude HTML/CSS)
* JVM languages (JAVA, Kotlin, Scala)
* C# (Unity)
* C/C++/ASM/PIC-C/FPGA
* Pascal/Delphi
* Javascript/Typescript
* Python/Ruby (I usually get something working when I need to use them but I am certainly not an expert there :)

##### OSS supporter

As developer, I used to consume open source software (in professional life but also for private side projects).
No doubt about the amazing job that these people do (biggup to them btw).

Since a few years now, I also try to contribute to the open source software community.
I am surely not maintainer of huge projects such as Linux Kernel but still I try to share what I can with others at my humble level also
via this blog :)

If you are interested in my open sources contributions you can have a look at my [open source projects](/oss/) or my contributions
on [Github](https://github.com/sebastienvermeille) directly.
