## Pre requisite
If you have no notion or are a bit confuse about the concept of serverless, I encourage you to read first this small introduction article.

## Introduction
What if I tell you that you could host your web service such as an API REST, GraphQL, a static html content, or even more for free on the cloud ?

Yes it can be achieved and with **no cold time** and **for free** (Well it depends how intense you use it but let see it in details under)!
